## Understanding the codebase

Shop-Shop utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management. The core logic resides in the cartSlice.js file (or similar naming convention). This slice defines the initial state of the cart, reducers to handle cart actions (adding, removing, updating quantities, etc.), and action creators for dispatching these actions.

Here's a breakdown of the typical components
- cartSlice.js: Defines the cart state, reducers, and action creators.
-  Components: React components responsible for displaying products, managing the cart UI, and dispatching actions.
-  Redux Store: Centralized store containing the global application state.
